# Contributing

This repository is a reference implementation pattern. Changes should remain minimal, correct, and aligned with the canonical assertions in [reference-fonts-implementation](https://github.com/Monotype/reference-fonts-implementation).

## Process

1. Open an issue describing the proposed change and the reason
2. Submit a PR referencing the issue
3. Request review from appropriate stakeholders:
   - DevRel for pattern correctness and clarity
   - Engineering for technical accuracy
   - Legal for any changes affecting licensing guidance

## Style

- Keep the demo minimal — it demonstrates the variable font pattern, not a production UI
- The `@font-face` axis range declarations (`font-weight: 100 900`, `font-stretch: 75% 125%`) are intentional; do not reduce them to single values
- Do not commit font files; the `.gitignore` exclusion of font extensions must remain intact
- If a canonical assertion changes in the reference repo, update this pattern to stay aligned
